# Data-structure-textbook

This project aims to deepen our understanding of data structures by implementing them from scratch in C/C++.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Implement fundamental data structures in C/C++.
- Gain a deeper understanding of how these data structures work.
- Collaborate and learn from each other.

## Reference Material

We are using the book **"Data Structures Explained Simply in C Language"** as our primary reference.
